Keccak-Internal-Permutation-in-C
================================

<b>Implementation of Keccak internal permutation in C</b>

Keccak the cryptographic sponge function family called Keccak, which has been selected by NIST to become the new SHA-3 standard. The sponge function is a generalization of the concept of cryptographic hash function with infinite output and 
can perform quasi all symmetric cryptographic functions, from hashing to pseudo-random number generation to authenticated encryption.

The implementation of only internal permutation in C language is doen here. 

The <u>"Keccak Hash Function"</u> and  <u>"Encryption using the Keccak sponge construction"</u> will be available in other repositories soon.
